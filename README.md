# IronGram

The IronGram assignment is a small web app that is designed to be similar to Snapchat. The user creates a username and 
password, and can then specify the person they'd like to send a photo to. The sender can determine the number of seconds
that the photo is displayed to the receiver.

This project was built in Java using the Spring framework, utilizing Hibernate, SHA1 password encryption, and an H2 database.
The front-end was built using HTML and JavaScript.
